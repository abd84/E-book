# Improvements Made - October 21, 2025

## âœ… Completed Modifications

### 1. **Table Generation - Now Optional & Contextual** âœ“

**Problem:** Tables were being forced in every section, even when not needed.

**Solution:** Modified prompt to make tables optional and contextual.

**Changes in `ebook_agent.py`:**
```python
# OLD: "IMPORTANT - Include 1-2 well-designed tables"
# NEW: "Optional - Include ONLY if truly beneficial"

TABLE GUIDELINES (Optional - Include ONLY if truly beneficial):
- Add tables ONLY when they genuinely enhance understanding
- If content is better explained through narrative, skip tables
- Good candidates: comparisons, statistics, timelines, specifications
- Skip for: philosophical discussions, narrative content, concepts
```

**Benefits:**
- More natural content flow
- Tables appear only where they add value
- Better readability for conceptual topics
- AI makes intelligent decisions about table inclusion

### 2. **Abstract Length - Maximum 9 Lines** âœ“

**Problem:** Abstracts were too long and verbose.

**Solution:** Created dedicated abstract prompt with strict length limit.

**Changes in `ebook_agent.py`:**
```python
def write_section(section_title, context, topic, is_conclusion=False, is_abstract=False):
    if is_abstract:
        prompt = (
            "Write a concise abstract for an ebook about '{topic}'.\n"
            "IMPORTANT: Keep it SHORT - maximum 9 lines or 150-200 words.\n"
            "Write as a single, well-structured paragraph.\n"
            "Do NOT use headings, bullet points, or section breaks."
        )
```

**Post-processing:**
```python
if section_title.lower() == "abstract":
    section_text = write_section(section_title, "", topic, is_abstract=True)
    # Enforce 9-line limit
    lines = [line for line in section_text.split('\n') if line.strip()]
    if len(lines) > 9:
        section_text = '\n'.join(lines[:9])
```

**Result:**
- Concise, focused abstracts
- Maximum 9 lines (~150-200 words)
- Single paragraph format
- Professional overview

### 3. **Table of Contents - No Duplicate Heading** âœ“

**Problem:** Manual TOC heading conflicted with Pandoc's auto-generated TOC.

**Solution:** Added clear comment explaining Pandoc auto-generates TOC.

**Changes in `chapters/template.md`:**
```markdown
<!-- ================================================================
     TABLE OF CONTENTS (Auto-generated by Pandoc)
     Note: Pandoc automatically generates TOC when toc: true is set
     The toc-title is set to "Table of Contents" in YAML metadata
     ================================================================ -->

\tableofcontents
```

**YAML metadata already configured:**
```yaml
toc: true
toc-depth: 3
toc-title: "Table of Contents"
number-sections: true
```

**Result:**
- No duplicate TOC headings
- Clean, professional TOC
- Proper page numbering
- 3-level depth navigation

### 4. **Enhanced Copyright Page** âœ“

**Problem:** Copyright page was too brief and lacked proper legal language.

**Solution:** Expanded with comprehensive copyright notice and license details.

**New Copyright Page Content:**
```markdown

## Preface

In an era of rapid technological advancement, access to quality 
educational content has become more important than ever. This ebook 
represents a new approach to knowledge disseminationâ€”one that 
harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to create 
comprehensive, accessible, and timely information on subjects 
that matter.

{{PREFACE_TEXT}}

This book has been generated using advanced AI technology, 
specifically designed to synthesize information, present clear 
explanations, and structure content in a pedagogically sound manner. 
While AI-generated, the content is grounded in established knowledge, 
current research, and best practices in the field. Every effort has 
been made to ensure accuracy, clarity, and relevance to contemporary 
understanding of the subject.

We recognize that AI-generated content represents both an opportunity 
and a responsibility. As such, readers are encouraged to engage 
critically with the material, cross-reference key points with primary 
sources where appropriate, and view this ebook as a starting point 
for deeper exploration rather than a definitive authority.

Whether you are a student, professional, educator, or curious learner, 
we hope this ebook serves as a valuable resource in your journey of 
discovery and understanding. The future of learning is collaborativeâ€”
between human curiosity and technological capabilityâ€”and we are 
excited to be part of that evolution.
