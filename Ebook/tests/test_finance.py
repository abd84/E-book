    Debt management strategies vary significantly in their approach and effectiveness. 
    The debt consolidation method involves combining multiple debts into a single loan 
    with a lower interest rate, simplifying monthly payments and potentially reducing 
    overall interest costs. This approach works best for individuals with good credit 
    scores who can secure favorable loan terms. In contrast, the debt avalanche method 
    focuses on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first while making 
    minimum payments on others. This mathematical approach minimizes total interest 
    paid over time but requires discipline and patience. Financial advisors often 
    recommend the avalanche method for those committed to aggressive debt reduction, 
    while consolidation suits those seeking simplification and immediate relief from 
    multiple payment schedules.

    snowball methods, freeing up cash flow for wealth building. Phase 3 (Years 3-5):

    transitioning from debt reduction to wealth accumulation. Phase 4 (Years 5-10): 
    Diversifying investments, considering real estate, and optimizing tax strategies.

    Modern portfolio theory emphasizes diversification across multiple asset classes 
    to optimize returns while managing risk. A well-structured portfolio balances 
    stocks (domestic and international), bonds (government and corporate), real estate 
    investment trusts (REITs), and alternative investments. The allocation depends on 
    factors including age, risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. 
    Younger investors typically favor aggressive growth with 80-90% equity exposure, 
    while those approaching retirement shift toward conservative allocations with 
    40-60% in fixed income securities. Regular rebalancing ensures the portfolio 
    maintains target allocations, selling appreciated assets and buying undervalued 
    ones. This systematic approach capitalizes on market volatility while maintaining 
    disciplined investment principles.
