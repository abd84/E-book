Original Prompt:
A modern diagram showing the layers of a neural network with colorful nodes and connections

Detailed Description:
## Ebook Illustration: Neural Network Diagram

**1. Main Subject and Composition:**

*   **Main Subject:** A visually compelling and informative diagram of a simplified, yet representative, neural network.
*   **Composition:** Horizontal format, with the network flowing from left to right, depicting information processing. The diagram should be uncluttered and easy to understand at a glance, even for someone unfamiliar with neural networks. The overall feeling should be clean and modern, not overly busy or intimidating.
*   **Number of Layers:** Depict 3-4 distinct layers: Input, Hidden (at least one layer), and Output. The number of nodes in each layer can vary, but aim for a balanced and visually appealing arrangement (e.g., Input: 4 nodes, Hidden 1: 6 nodes, Hidden 2: 4 nodes, Output: 2 nodes).
*   **Placement:** The entire network should be centered horizontally within the frame, leaving some breathing room around the edges. The layers should be clearly separated vertically, allowing space for the connections to be easily visible.

**2. Color Scheme and Mood:**

*   **Color Scheme:** Modern and vibrant, but not overwhelming. Use a harmonious palette with contrasting colors to highlight different layers or aspects of the network.
    *   **Input Layer:** A cool color, such as a light, desaturated teal (#A0E7E5).
    *   **Hidden Layers:** Varying shades of a warm color family, like orange or yellow. Hidden Layer 1 could be a soft apricot (#FFDAC1), while Hidden Layer 2 could be a slightly more saturated mustard yellow (#FFD166).
    *   **Output Layer:** A complementary color to the input layer, like a light, desaturated coral (#E29587).
    *   **Connections:** Thin, light grey (#D3D3D3) lines, possibly with a slight gradient fade as they connect from one node to another.
*   **Mood:** The overall mood should be informative, modern, sophisticated, and optimistic. The bright colors contribute to a feeling of technological advancement and understanding.

**3. Style:**

*   **Style:** A blend of diagrammatic and infographic. The diagrammatic aspect focuses on the accurate representation of the network's structure. The infographic aspect uses visual cues like color and node size variation to enhance understanding and engagement.
*   **Visual Texture:** The nodes should have a subtle gradient or a very slight inner shadow to give them some depth and avoid appearing flat. The connecting lines should be clean and crisp, possibly with a slight antialiasing to avoid jagged edges.
*   **Overall Look:** Clean, minimalist, and visually appealing. Aim for a design that is both aesthetically pleasing and informative.

**4. Key Visual Elements to Include:**

*   **Nodes:** Circular nodes representing neurons in each layer. The size of the nodes should be consistent within each layer but can vary between layers to subtly indicate the relative importance or number of neurons.
*   **Connections:** Thin, clear lines connecting each node in one layer to every node in the subsequent layer (fully connected network). As mentioned above, the connections should be a light grey color.
*   **Directionality:** Subtle visual cues to indicate the direction of information flow (left to right). This can be achieved through the slight gradient fade on the connection lines (lighter at the originating node, slightly darker at the destination node).
*   **Activation Emphasis (Optional):**  For a few select connections (maybe 2-3), introduce a slight thickening and colorization (perhaps a vibrant blue or green) to highlight the active flow of information. This could be positioned towards the right-most hidden layer and leading to the output.
*   **Background:** Clean, solid white or a very light grey (#F0F0F0) to provide good contrast and avoid distraction.

**5. Text or Labels:**

*   **Layer Labels:** Short and descriptive labels above each layer, horizontally centered. Font: A clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto) in a dark grey (#333333) color.
    *   "Input Layer" (above the leftmost layer)
    *   "Hidden Layer 1" (above the first hidden layer)
    *   "Hidden Layer 2" (if a second hidden layer is present)
    *   "Output Layer" (above the rightmost layer)
*   **Optional Node Labels:**  Consider very small labels inside or adjacent to a *few* (not all) nodes. These could be simple identifiers like "Input 1", "Hidden 1-2", "Output 1" to give the reader a sense of the node's function without overwhelming them. Use the same sans-serif font as the layer labels but in a smaller size and lighter grey color.

By following this detailed description, the illustrator or AI image generator should be able to create a compelling and informative visual representation of a neural network suitable for an ebook.
