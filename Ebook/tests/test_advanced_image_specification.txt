Detailed Specification:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, here's a detailed visual specification and optimized prompts to create a system architecture diagram for an AI-powered diagnostic system in healthcare, suitable for an ebook.

**VISUAL SPECIFICATION**

**1. Composition:**

*   **Overall Layout:** Horizontal 16:9 aspect ratio.  The diagram should be split into three main vertical sections, representing the data input (left), the AI processing core (center, focal point), and the output/results/clinical application (right).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   **Focal Point:** The central AI Processing Core. This section should be larger and more visually prominent.
    *   **Primary Elements:** Data Input and Clinical Application sections flanking the central core.
    *   **Secondary Elements:** Arrows and connecting lines showing data flow. These lines should be thinner and less visually prominent than the main elements.
*   **Rule of Thirds:** Align key elements along the lines of a rule-of-thirds grid. For instance, position the start of the data input section on the left vertical line and the start of the clinical application section on the right vertical line.  The AI core should be centered.

**2. Color Scheme:**

*   **Background:** #F8F9FA (Soft White) - Almost white, providing good contrast.
*   **Data Input Section:**
    *   Background: #E9F5FF (Light Blue) - Subtle gradient from top to bottom, transitioning to the background color.
    *   Text & Icons: #212529 (Dark Grey) - Highly readable text.
*   **AI Processing Core:**
    *   Background: #D3E9E2 (Light Green) - Gentle gradient from top to bottom.
    *   Central Icon (AI Brain): #34A853 (Medium Green)
    *   Text & Icons: #212529 (Dark Grey)
*   **Clinical Application Section:**
    *   Background: #E3F2FD (Light Blue) - Gradient.
    *   Text & Icons: #212529 (Dark Grey)
*   **Arrows & Lines:** #90A4AE (Medium Grey-Blue) - Subdued, to avoid overpowering the main sections.  Use lighter version of this for gradient effect.
*   **Highlight Color (for key connections/data flow):** #FFC107 (Amber) - Use sparingly.

**3. Typography:**

*   **Font Family:** Open Sans (or similar clean, sans-serif font).  Use different weights for hierarchy.
*   **Section Titles (Data Input, AI Processing, Clinical Application):** Open Sans Bold, 18pt, #212529, Centered above each section.
*   **Sub-Section Titles (e.g., "Medical Images," "Lab Results"):** Open Sans Semi-Bold, 14pt, #212529
*   **Data Labels (e.g., "Patient ID," "Diagnosis"):** Open Sans Regular, 12pt, #212529
*   **Line/Arrow Labels (optional, but if used, e.g., "Processed Data"):** Open Sans Italic, 10pt, #212529
*   **Font Spacing:** Set the line height to 1.3x the font size for optimal readability.

**4. Visual Elements:**

*   **Data Input Section (Left):**
    *   **Medical Images:** Icon of an X-ray or MRI scan (simplified anatomical outline).
    *   **Lab Results:** Icon of a blood sample vial and test tubes.
    *   **Patient History:** Icon of a medical record folder with a heart symbol.
    *   **Genomic Data:** Icon of a DNA helix.
    *   Include labels beneath each icon: "Medical Images," "Lab Results," "Patient History," "Genomic Data."
*   **AI Processing Core (Center):**
    *   **Central Icon:** Stylized Brain icon representing the AI. This brain should have interconnected nodes. Use subtle gradients to give it depth.
    *   **Sub-Elements (internal to the brain):**
        *   "Machine Learning Algorithms" - Rectangle with rounded corners.
        *   "Data Analysis" - Circular icon with magnifying glass.
        *   "Neural Networks" - Network of connected nodes.
        *   Small labels for each of these sub-elements.
*   **Clinical Application Section (Right):**
    *   **Diagnosis Support:** Icon of a stethoscope with a checkmark.
    *   **Treatment Planning:** Icon of a prescription pad and a pill.
    *   **Personalized Medicine:** Icon of a DNA strand merging with a heart symbol.
    *   **Predictive Analysis:** Icon of a chart/graph showing an upward trend.
    *   Include labels beneath each icon: "Diagnosis Support," "Treatment Planning," "Personalized Medicine," "Predictive Analysis."
*   **Arrows/Lines:** Use bezier curves with arrowheads to connect the sections.  Arrows should originate from each data input icon and lead to the AI Core. Then, arrows should flow from the AI Core to each clinical application icon. Use dotted lines for elements that flow together.
*   **Patient Icon:** Use a gender-neutral stick figure outline (simple, compassionate style). Place this icon slightly above and centered relative to the entire diagram, to emphasize the patient-centric nature of the system.

**5. Style Details:**

*   **Line Weights:**
    *   Section outlines: 1.5pt
    *   Arrows/Lines: 1pt
    *   Icon outlines: 1pt
*   **Shadows:** Use subtle drop shadows for all icons and boxes to give them depth. Shadow color should be a slightly darker shade of the element's background color, with a small offset (e.g., 2px offset, 5px blur).
*   **Gradients:** Use subtle linear gradients (top-to-bottom) for the backgrounds of each section to add visual interest.
*   **Effects:** Consider using a "glow" effect (subtle, low opacity) on the central AI brain icon to emphasize its importance.
*   **Rounded Corners:** Use rounded corners on all rectangles and boxes for a softer, more modern look. (Radius: 5-7px)

**6. Dimensions:**

*   **Overall Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (e.g., 1920px x 1080px).
*   **Section Widths:**  AI Processing Core should be approximately 1.5x wider than either the Data Input or Clinical Application sections.  Adjust for visual balance.
*   **Icon Sizes:**  Make sure icons are easily discernible (e.g., 80px x 80px)
*   **Spacing:**  Ensure ample spacing between elements to avoid clutter.  Use padding within the rectangles.

**7. Technical Notes:**

*   **Software:** Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or similar vector graphics software.
*   **Vector Format:** Save the final artwork as a vector file (e.g., SVG, AI, EPS) to ensure scalability without loss of quality.
*   **High Resolution:**  Export a high-resolution raster version (e.g., PNG, JPEG) for use in the ebook.  Ensure it is at least 300 DPI for print quality.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background for users with visual impairments.

**Optimized Prompts for Image Generation:**

**1. DALL-E 3 Prompt:**

```
Create a modern, clean system architecture diagram for an ebook section about "AI-Powered Diagnostic Systems in Healthcare". The diagram should have a 16:9 aspect ratio and a compassionate, trustworthy medical illustration style with medical blues, greens, soft whites, and caring tones.

```

**Explanation of Prompt Elements:**

*   **(Keywords: Weight):** Using parentheses and a weight (e.g., `(high quality:1.2)`) emphasizes the importance of those keywords.  A value of 1.2 is a common way to tell the AI to prioritize these features.
*   **Negative Prompts:**  These tell the AI what *not* to include.  Helps avoid common pitfalls like low resolution, text, and artifacts.
*   **Parameters:**  `--ar` (aspect ratio), `--style` (Midjourney), `--s` (stylize strength), `--q` (quality), `--v` (Midjourney version), are specific to the AI tool you are using. Adjust them as needed.  Stable Diffusion parameters like "Steps," "Sampler," "CFG scale," and "Seed" control the generation process.
*   **Model (Stable Diffusion):** Choosing a good model designed for illustration is crucial for image quality.

By following this detailed specification and using the optimized prompts, you should be able to create a visually appealing and informative system architecture diagram that effectively illustrates the AI-powered diagnostic system in the context of healthcare for your ebook. Remember to iterate and refine based on the initial results generated by the AI or your chosen illustrator. Good luck!
