Here's the detailed image generation prompt:

Create a futuristic, sleek illustration with an aspect ratio of 16:9, depicting an AI-powered diagnostic system. The composition follows the rule of thirds, placing the primary focal point—a stylized, glowing neural network core—at the intersection of the upper-right lines. The foreground contains abstract representations of patient data streams, rendered as translucent, electric cyan (#00d9ff) flowing lines emanating from the bottom-left corner, fading into the midground. The midground features the AI diagnostic system itself: a central processing unit depicted as a silver (#c0c0c0) cube with intricate, glowing cyan (#00d9ff) circuitry details, elevated on a matte carbon fiber platform with a subtle purple (#8b5cf6) ambient glow originating from beneath. This cube is interconnected with holographic displays showing medical imagery (X-rays, MRIs) in shades of gray with cyan (#00d9ff) overlays, arranged in a hierarchical structure. The background fades into a deep navy blue (#1a1f3a) gradient, starting darker at the top (RGB: 26, 31, 58) and lightening slightly towards the horizon line. Negative space occupies the left third of the image, enhancing the modern feel. The neural network core emits a strong, soft white (#ffffff) light source, casting subtle shadows beneath the components. Rim lighting in electric cyan (#00d9ff) highlights the edges of the silver cube, creating a neon glow effect. The lighting is dramatic, with lens flares emanating from the digital displays. The rendering technique is photorealistic with illustrated elements, focusing on sharp line work and geometric precision. Glossy metallic surfaces on the silver cube contrast with the matte carbon fiber, creating textural variety. The resolution should be 4K, ensuring high-quality details and sharp edge definition. Depth of field is shallow, blurring the background slightly to emphasize the focal point. The viewing angle is isometric, providing a clear perspective of the system's components. Each medical image display should feature micro-details such as simulated scan lines and subtle glitches. The overall aesthetic should evoke a sense of technological advancement and diagnostic precision. The image should include a subtle digital grid overlay, adding a layer of technical complexity. The interconnected components visualize the flow of data from patient input to AI analysis and diagnostic output.
