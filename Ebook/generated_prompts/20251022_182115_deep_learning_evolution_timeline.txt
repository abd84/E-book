A horizontal timeline illustration, aspect ratio 16:9, depicting the evolution of deep learning; foreground features a glossy, silver (#c0c0c0) stylized neuron model with electric cyan (#00d9ff) rim lighting, placed at (x=0.1, y=0.5) using rule of thirds, casting a soft, subtle purple (#8b5cf6) shadow extending towards the midground; the midground consists of a timeline flowing from left to right, anchored in deep navy blue (#1a1f3a); the timeline path is a thin, silver metallic line with chronological markers represented by floating, isometric cubes; each cube highlights a milestone, starting with "1943: McCulloch-Pitts Neuron" represented by a simple geometric shape, progressing to "1980: Neocognitron" with a slightly more complex layered structure, then "1998: LeNet-5 (CNN)" visualized as a stacked convolutional layer icon, "2012: AlexNet" depicted by a deeper, more intricate neural network architecture with neon cyan highlights radiating from its core, and culminating in "2017: Transformer" shown as a complex, holographic interwoven mesh; the transformer cube should be the largest and most detailed, with lens flares originating from its central processing unit; each milestone cube is interconnected by faint, pulsing cyan lines indicating the flow of innovation; negative space is utilized above and below the timeline to give a futuristic and uncluttered feel; background is a gradient from deep navy blue (#1a1f3a) at the bottom to a slightly lighter shade with a hint of purple at the top, creating depth; lighting originates from multiple sources: a strong cyan light source above and slightly to the left, creating dramatic highlights on the metallic components and casting soft shadows; ambient lighting is a subtle blue hue; the illustration should be rendered in a sleek, minimalist vector style with sharp edges and clean lines; textures include glossy metallic surfaces on the cubes, matte carbon fiber for the timeline base, and translucent glass with subtle reflections for the holographic transformer mesh; resolution should be 4096x2304 pixels for publication quality; depth of field should be shallow, focusing sharply on the foreground neuron and gradually blurring towards the background; perspective is isometric, providing a technical and precise viewing angle; edges should be sharply defined except for the shadows, which should have a soft gradient; the overall artistic style is inspired by modern technology product visualizations, emphasizing clarity and visual appeal; saturation is moderate, ensuring the cyan highlights pop against the dark background; brightness levels are carefully balanced to create contrast and depth.
