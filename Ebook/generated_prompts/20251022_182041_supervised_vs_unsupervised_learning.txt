A hyper-detailed illustration with a 16:9 aspect ratio, split vertically down the center to represent Supervised (left) vs. Unsupervised (right) Learning. Foreground: left side features a sleek, stylized robot arm (metallic silver, #c0c0c0) reaching towards labeled data cubes (electric cyan, #00d9ff) arranged in a pyramid formation at coordinates (x:0.2, y:0.7), while the right side shows a similar robot arm (navy blue, #1a1f3a) analyzing a scattered cloud of unlabeled data points (subtle purple, #8b5cf6) at coordinates (x:0.8, y:0.7); size relationship: robot arms are approximately 20% of the image height, data cubes/points are 10%. Midground: A translucent glass panel with a digital grid overlay separates the two sides, subtly reflecting the colors of each side; gradient: light cyan (#00d9ff) to light purple (#8b5cf6) along the vertical center. Background: Deep navy blue (#1a1f3a) fading into a darker shade at the top, creating a sense of depth; subtle bokeh effect with faint purple and cyan orbs. Lighting: Primary light source is above and slightly behind the center, creating a rim light on both robot arms and dramatic highlights on the metallic surfaces; intensity: high (2000 lumens); color temperature: cool white (6500K). Secondary light sources are positioned below each robot arm, casting soft ambient blue light (#1a1f3a) upwards, with a slight neon glow around the data cubes/points. Shadows are soft and diffused, originating from the data structures and robot arms. A subtle lens flare emanates from the center of the dividing glass panel. Saturation levels are moderate, emphasizing the electric cyan and subtle purple. The artistic style leans towards a futuristic, minimalist vector illustration with sharp edges and clean lines, reminiscent of early 2000s digital art, rendered at 8K resolution for maximum detail. The metallic surfaces are glossy with subtle reflections, while the robot arms have matte carbon fiber sections; material properties: high reflectivity, low roughness. Depth of field is shallow, focusing on the robot arms and data, blurring the background slightly. The viewing angle is isometric, providing a balanced perspective of both sides. Edge definition is sharp for the geometric shapes and gradient for the background fade. Negative space is used effectively in the upper portion of the image to create a modern and uncluttered feel. The central dividing line symbolizes the fundamental difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
